# File Tools

## Description
Created this in the intentions to clear some of the clutter that I had laying around and organize everything.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python 3.10

### Installing

* You can start by installing this by in releases, or cloning it.


### Executing program
* Open the script with the command below

* python3 fileTools.py 

* Follow the steps that are given to you within the terminal

## Help
It is known that there may not be any folder names matching with the filetype(Can't have a folder name mp4, inside of the folder that you are organizing)

* Causes the script to fail, just delete the already made folder and retry
